# yugiohbot
Small library for myself to create clicker bots for yugioh duel links

bbox.py holds the data types used in each script

screencap is a small tool that automates capturing a rectangle in the screen and its boundary coordinates
(Creates a python script called "bboxes.py" so you can use screen captures as python objects in your clicker bot)

rmbbox removes a saved screen capture 

shrun.py is a small wrapper on calling subprocesses

screencomp is a small tool to check if the saved image for the bounding coordinates is appeared on screen (Deprecated, use BBox.compare() instead)

main.py is an example clicker bot script
